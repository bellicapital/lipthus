	- Unfortunately, Microsoft has added a clever new
	- "feature" to Internet Explorer. If the text of
	- an error's message is "too small", specifically
	- less than 512 bytes, Internet Explorer returns
	- its own error message. You can turn that off,
	- but it's pretty tricky to find switch called
	- "smart error messages". That means, of course,
	- that short error messages are censored by default.
	- IIS always returns error messages that are long
	- enough to make Internet Explorer happy. The
	- workaround is pretty simple: pad the error
	- message with a big comment like this to push it
	- over the five hundred and twelve bytes minimum.
	- Of course, that's exactly what you're reading
	- right now.
